# PSL-WEEK-2023-GRAPH-THEORY

----------------------------------------------

In this repository, I gathered the material covered in Day 3 of the PSL-WEEK 2023. 

In this 8 hours workshop presented by Prof. Gr√©goire Pacreau, we discussed **Graph Theory** based ML applications in Finance ([slides](https://github.com/abouhadid/PSL-WEEK-2023-GRAPH-THEORY/blob/main/slides.pdf)) followed by a practical case (see the [notebook](https://github.com/abouhadid/PSL-WEEK-2023-GRAPH-THEORY/blob/main/Graphs_and_Machine_Learning.ipynb).
